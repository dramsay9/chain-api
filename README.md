# ChainAPI for Air Quality

This is an adaptation of the [ChainAPI project](https://github.com/ResEnv/chain-api) for Air Quality.  I huge amount is owed to Spencer Russell and the ChainAPI development group, please check out the original project from which this was forked for information about the architecture of ChainAPI.

This readme focuses on the Air Quality adaptation and ontology.  This version of ChainAPI is part of [LearnAir, a master's thesis](https://www.davidbramsay.com/learnair).

**code written for LearnAir includes:**
+ [chainCrawler and chainSearcher](https://github.com/dramsay9/chaincrawler) - *a web crawler and a breadth-first-search tool for the semantic web data achitecture ChainAPI*
+ [chainTraverser and chainDataPush](https://github.com/dramsay9/chainlearnairdata) - *a stateful web spider to traverse, upload, modify, and interact with ChainAPI nodes and data, including pushing data from Excel files*
+ [chainProcessor](https://github.com/dramsay9/chaindataprocessor) - *a scalable machine learning crawler framework, which automatically crawls and downloads data from a list of 'known' device types in ChainAPI, processes their data using a device-specific model (that automatically updates when new data is found), and uploads that processed data back into ChainAPI*
